# Bulls and Cows

A code-breaking game (which is what Mastermind was based on) with the following rules.

The creator hides a secret 4 digit number The guesser attempts to guess the secret number The creator responds according
to the following rules:
For each digit that matches and is in the correct position = Bull For each digit that matches and is in the incorrect
position = Cow

For example:

```
Secret = 1234
Guess = 9213

Response: 1 Bull, 2 Cows (bulls = [2], cows = [1, 3])
```

The guesser wins when they correctly identify the secret number.

The puzzle is to build a computer assisted version of the game. The computer will play the creator, and the player the
guesser.

The requirements are:

Generate a secret Obtain a guess from the user Provide a response to the guess Inform the user if they have successfully
guessed the answer
